# Movie-Guesser

## Description

Python program I wrote during my first year. 

The user answers a series of questions based on the (currently limited) database of movies. Based on the sequence of answers, the program outputs the matching movie.

## Usage

To use, simply download the git repository and cd into the file. The program can be run with the following command:

`python movie_guesser.py`
